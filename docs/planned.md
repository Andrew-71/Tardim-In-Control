# Planned features
I do not guarantee these will be added or have a timeline, but here are features I designed and wish to implement in the future

* ![Block model](assets/img/blocks/tardim_dock.png) TARDIM Dock - A block that lets you get to a location by a simple ID and handles location and rotation for you. This will also let TARDIMs land on Create: Aeronautics contraptions once that mod is out
* ![Item texture](assets/img/blocks/cartridge_blue.png) Location cartridges - No code way to save location to an item and travel there whenever you want.
* ![Wearable model](assets/img/blocks/jammer.png) Personal location jammer - Wearable item that lets you prevent others from locking onto your position.

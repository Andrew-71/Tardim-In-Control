# ComputerCraft compatibility
If you have ComputerCraft: Tweaked installed, 
TARDIM: IC provides quite a few peripherals.
The main one is new Digital TARDIM Interface,
which gives you complete control over your TARDIM.
However, some TARDIM blocks also receive getters for information related to them.

## ComputerCraft for beginners
ComputerCraft adds working computers to minecraft, controlled by Lua language. 
If you are new, [CC's official discord](https://discord.com/servers/minecraft-computer-mods-477910221872824320) has a lot of people who can help.\
I also suggest taking a look at [Lua's website](https://www.lua.org/start.html) and [CC: Tweaked's documentaion](https://tweaked.cc)\
Please do not ask questions about CC itself in TARDIM: IC's Discord.

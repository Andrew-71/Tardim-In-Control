TODO for 1.2 and beyond
re-written 21.06.23

NEW ====================

Blocks:
    Cartridge Loader
        2 buttons, one to load information from a cartridge, another to write it.
        Has a slot where when r-clicked with a cartridge inserts it/Takes it out
    TARDIM Dock
        Has a GUI, where you can configure:
            * Name/id
            * Landing facing
            * White/Blacklist of users who can land
            * (Potentially) Fallback id if this one is disabled
        When configured, a CC method/TARDIM command can take you to it
        When powered by a lever, no TARDIM can land (and potentially take off)
    Food Machine
        2 buttons. One changed chosen food (hopefully shown on screen), another throws it out.
        Uses a bit of fuel but you get FOOD!
Items
    Personal Jammer
        When worn, other players are unable to locate the user with /locate command
    Location cartridge
        Contains coordinates, dimension of place and date when it was written to (potentially other metadata using CC)
        Can be locked like a map
        Potentially can be inserted into a disk drive peripheral

Compat:
    CC:
        * Look into what other things can be improved, how to automate doc creation
        * Add creative digital TARDIM interface... (maybe remove TARDIM from item name?)
        * Add a craftable treasure disk with pre-installed useful programs
    Create:
        Update to 0.5.1, add more display sources

Code:
    Datapack-driven way to control where a TARDIM can land and at what price.

Achievements:
(need to decide on root)
    "Nobody needs soup more than me"
        Get soup from TARDIM's food machine

    "Power of the Redstone"
        Activate a redstone input

    "From Russia with love"
        Set exterior to Soviet Chronobox (or any other potential USSR-themed exteriors)

    "Cyber-Upgrade"
        Craft a digital interface

    "???"
        Register a dock

    "It appears to be... jammed!"
        "I've lost the bleeps, I lost the sweeps, and I lost the creeps."
        Put on a location jammer

    "I will always remember..."
        Save (or maybe lock like a map?) a location cartridge


UPDATES ================

Blocks:
    Redstone TARDIM Interface - add powered blockstate
    (TARDIM) Fuel Storage - add comparator output based on fuel (0 - 9 I think)
    (TARDIM) Time Rotor - add comparator/redstone output when in flight
Code:
    Add config&datapack support (e.g. disable compat, more food machine food, only getters from digital interface)
    Make 1WTC fix package names on forge and further improve multi-loader structure
        (so that it's not just Fabric to  Forge translation at last second).
    Overall some code from TARDIM: IC might make its way into TARDIM hopefully
    Try to smash all TODOs and warnings
Outside appearance:
    Make a proper wiki/docs with CC methods, item recipes and explanations. Maybe even technical things.
    Update README and Modrinth/Curse pages
    Look into re-licensing and/or making proper public facing source code
    Improve Discord server
    Improve/Change icon
    Make background image for modrinth

LOOK INTO ==============
Things to overall re-search
* Applications for SWD Discord moderator. Could be a path to actually getting the bloody source code access
* Making TARDIM doors sync between TARDIM and external dimension
* Some kind of CC scanner method to see the outside (and?) GUI panel that lets you see said outside (or pre-installed iso. program)
    see: dev9551's isometric renderer (or pine3d)
* Advanced drive/fuel storage for interstellar travel. Like a "stores 10000 fuel but you have to use it at once"
* Change block appearance based on item name when placed (like Supplementaries)
* More Create compat: engine powered by tardim fuel and way to "wind up" the TARDIM
* (Likely only if access to TARDIM source) Weblate for localisation
* Possibly an enchantment that works same as personal jammer

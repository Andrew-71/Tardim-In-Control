=== HOW MANY PROBLEMS TARDIM HAS?! ===
1. A few log messages definitely left from testing (e.g. aklfjsjsfw)
2. isValidFlightPath is private on Fabric
3. FABRIC AND FORGE HAVE DIFFERENT JAVA IMPORT PATHS
4. [FIXED] Adding custom commands was private for literally 0 reason
5. com.swdteam.tardim.common.data.DimensionMapReloadListener has modid tutorial in
        public ResourceLocation getFabricId() {
            return new ResourceLocation("tutorial", "tardim_dimension_lookup");
        }

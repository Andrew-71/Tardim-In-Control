![TARDIM: IC Banner](./media/banner.png)
### All of time and space, *now automated and improved*.

This mod is an addon for the [TARDIM mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tardim), 
and adds a way to control and manage your time (but mostly space) machine with new blocks, redstone, 
and even other mods like [ComputerCraft: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc) or [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create)

### Features:
TODO: Re-make this for 1.2
* Digital TARDIM interface: ComputerCraft peripheral that lets you control a TARDIM using computers! Full list of methods is available in the [Javadoc](http://andrey71.me/TARDIM-ic-docs/su/a71/tardim_ic/tardim_ic/DigitalInterfacePeripheral.html) (Sorry for  that, this is the best auto-generated docs I could find for now). The peripheral supports almost all commands that the TARDIM computer panel has.
* Redstone TARDIM Input: New block that lets you execute a TARDIM command with the power of redstone! After saving a command, this block executes it every time it gets powered by redstone
* *This is just the beginning, there are more features to come!*

### Example use-cases
* Make a dashboard to monitor fuel levels, current location, and other information on a screen in a nice way.
* Get refined control over your TARDIM, such as saving and loading locations, or setting a destination in a GUI.
* Add visual effects that activate during flight e.g. note blocks or Create mod contraptions.

The possibilities are endless, the only limit is your imagination!

### FAQ

**Is this for Fabric or Forge?**
: Both! As a Fabric player who recognises Forge's large playerbase, I support both major modloaders.

**Can I use this in my modpack?**
: Sure, as long as you don't claim the mod as your own. A link to this mod's page would be appreciated too.

**Will there be a 1.20 version and beyond?**
: As of v1.2 my focus on 1.19.2, but I will try my best to move to later versions as soon as this mod is fully stable,
and dependencies are out. The intention is to follow latest versions.

**I encountered a bug or have a suggestion. What do I do?**
: If you have a problem or suggestion, the best way to get them to me is through the project's Discord server.

**Do I need to install things like ComputerCraft or Create for this mod?**
: Nope! While I highly suggest you do (because digital interface is in my opinion the star of the show), 
you can enjoy a lot of TARDIM: In Control's features with only TARDIM installed. 
If you ever decide to add other optional dependencies, the relevant blocks will become available and craftable!

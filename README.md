# TARDIM: In Control
### All of time and space, *now automated*.

This mod is an addon for the [TARDIM mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tardim), and adds a way to control your time (but mostly space) machine using 
[ComputerCraft: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc) computers using a new "Digital TARDIM Interface" peripheral.

### How to use
* Place the Digital Interface peripheral inside your TARDIM.
* Connect a computer to the peripheral using a wired modem and wrap it with `peripheral.wrap()`.
* Call one of the many methods available to you.

All the methods can be found in the [API documentation](https:/google.com), and there are some examples in the [examples folder](examples)

### Example usecases
* Monitor fuel levels, current location, and other information on a screen in a nice way.
* Way to remotely summon your TARDIM to you, or to a specific location. (Using chunkloaders)
* Refined control of your TARDIM, such as saving and loading locations, or setting a destination in a GUI.
* Visual effects that activate during flight.

The possibilities are endless, the only limit is your imagination! (And coding skills)

### FAQ

Is this for Fabric or Forge?
: As a Fabric player who recognises Forge's large playerbase, I intend to support both major modloaders. 
However a version for one of them could be released a bit later than the other one's.

Can I use this in my modpack?
: Sure, as long as you credit me and link to this page.

Will there be a 1.19.3 version and beyond?
: Yes, I will try my best to update to later versions as soon as ComputerCraft: Tweaked and TARDIM receive stable versions for them.

Will you support earlier versions?
: I am not very familiar with those and therefore cannot make versions for before 1.19, 
however if there will be a lot of people asking for it I could try sometime in the future. But no gurantees.
